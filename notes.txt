will need separate files for these because it will get to messy


Using postman (http client) enables different types of http requests 
    - like post request to register route 
    - authorization headers
    - fantastic piece of software to deal with back end api

json webtoken module
    - creates token,
    - passport will validate it and extract the user's information from it

email & password login
    - validating email and password and make sure it exists 

12-Creating The JWT
    - create a token when  `res.json({ msg: "Success" });`

13-Passport JWT Authentication Strategy
    - login, will retrieve token for a user
    - then we tried to access a protected route, we did it without a token and got unauthorized back
    - then we added the correct token and now its responding with the user 
    - accepting tokens that will validate a user and access our protected routes
