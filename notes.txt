will need separate files for these because it will get to messy


Using postman (http client) enables different types of http requests 
    - like post request to register route 
    - authorization headers
    - fantastic piece of software to deal with back end api

json webtoken module
    - creates token,
    - passport will validate it and extract the user's information from it

email & password login
    - localhost:5000/api/users/register
    - validating email and password and make sure it exists 

12-Creating The JWT
    - create a token when  `res.json({ msg: "Success" });`

13-Passport JWT Authentication Strategy
    - login, will retrieve token for a user
    - then we tried to access a protected route, we did it without a token and got unauthorized back
    - then we added the correct token and now its responding with the user 
    - accepting tokens that will validate a user and access our protected routes 
    
14- validation handlers 1

    -validating login and user modules

15- validation handlers 2

    -finishing up validation for register and login 
    

17 - creating the profile module

    -created the profile model and exported it .
    
18 - Current user profile route

    - creating the profile route in routes/api/profile.js to handle back end

19  Create & Update Profile Routes

    - created post route to actually create the profile 

    .profile.js 
        -get everything in request.body
        - fill profile fields 
        - search for user by user.id
        - if they have a profile they are going to update it 
        - if they dont. Check if there is no handle by that name
                if there is it will send back an error

                and if not it will go ahead and create the profile
